### Proposing New Issues

If you want to work on a new feature, improvement, or bug fix:

1. Open an issue describing:
   - The problem
   - Proposed solution
   - Expected outcome
2. Wait for maintainer review and approval.
3. Only start working after the issue is approved and labeled.

Pull requests without an approved issue may be closed.
